Even or Odd

what the code does? It will check if the number the user wrote in Jenkins is even or odd.

the code will take a positive integer( num = "$1" );

It will take it and check if it is valid, if no it will fail ( X ) else it will continue to the calculation itself

number % 2 == 0, divides the number by two and gives a remainder. for example, 
10 % 2 = 0. 
5 % 2 = 1. 
452 % 2 = 0.
