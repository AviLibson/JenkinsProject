Even or Odd

what the code dose? It will check if the number the user wrote in Jenkins is even or odd.

the code will take a single number ( num = "$1" );

Then it will take it and check if it valid, if no it will fail ( X )
else it will continue to the calculation itself

number % 2 == 0, divides the number by two and gives a remainder. for example,
10 % 2 = 0.
5 % 2 = 1.
452 % 2 = 0.
